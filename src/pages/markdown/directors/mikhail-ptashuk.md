      Mikhail Nikolayevich Ptashuk was born on January 28, 1943 in a dugout, in
      which his mother was hiding from the Nazis, on the outskirts of the
      village of Fedyuki, Lyakhovichi district, Brest region. Children's
      memories and stories of fellow villagers about that bitter, heroic time
      determined the main direction in the work of Ptashuk.

      A talented film director died in a car accident in Moscow. On the eve of
      the tragedy, Mikhail Ptashuk flew from Hollywood to Moscow to present the
      Nika Cinema Prize. His painting "In August of the 44th ..." fell into all
      the main film award nominations. But, alas, the solemn ceremony was not
      destined to become a moment of glory for Ptashuk. It was from the stage in
      Moscow that the terrible news was first voiced: the car in which the
      Belarusian director was located flew into the oncoming lane.
