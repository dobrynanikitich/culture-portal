  Born on September 16, 1938 in the village of Valoki, Khoynitsky district, Gomel region. He graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of the Belarusian State University (1960), FIRC (workshop of Leonid Trauberg). In his films, journalism and lyrics live in harmonious unity. The theme of the past war and the village in which childhood and youth passed, is the leitmotif of most works, where Dashuk acts as a screenwriter and director. The fame was brought by a series of films under the general name “Khatyn Cycle” (1975-1978), created in collaboration with writers A. Adamovich, Y. Bryl and V. Kolesnik: the voices and faces of people who miraculously survived in the villages burned by the Nazis.
  A kind of continuation was the work with Svetlana Aleksievich - the series “The war has no woman’s face” (1980-1984). He created his own film studio, where he made documentary feature films about the events in Belarus - “Protest Cinema”.
  He made more than 80 documentaries and 2 feature films in his own scripts ("Two on the Island of Tears", 1986 and "Sweet Poison of Love", 1995).
